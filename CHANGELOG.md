## [1.0.3] - 2026-07-03

### Changed
- Standardized UI components (Settings/Toggles) to match native macOS aesthetics.
- Replaced custom toggle switches with native macOS `SwitchToggleStyle`.
- Improved UI alignment by allowing components to size naturally and align right in settings.
- Moved search bars and action buttons (like refresh/status badges) to the native macOS Navigation Toolbar.
- Renamed "Game System Info" section to "App Info".

### Fixed
- Fixed app launching to the incorrect default tab (now opens to the Home/Profile page).
- Implemented full Navigation History, allowing the macOS Back/Forward toolbar buttons to correctly navigate through previously visited tabs.
- Reduced sizes of toggle switches and info popover buttons to be properly proportional to the surrounding text.
- Removed redundant English parenthetical texts from localized Thai UI strings.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-07-03

### Added
- Added full **Japanese Localization** (Trilingual Support).

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where navigation titles and `String(localized:)` did not dynamically update when changing languages in-app.
- Fixed a type mismatch bug that caused save file money to display as corrupted memory addresses when formatted with commas.
- Improved localized format strings in the Saves View to respect native language grammar structures (e.g. "ฟาร์ม our's" instead of "our's Farm" in Thai).
- Cleaned up redundant English parentheses in Thai and Japanese UI texts.
